Designed and developed a <strong>Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system</strong> to enhance <strong>image search accuracy and efficiency</strong> by leveraging <strong>visual content</strong> rather than relying solely on metadata. 

With the rapid growth of <strong>digital imaging technologies</strong> and the increasing availability of <strong>digital images</strong>, traditional <strong>keyword-based retrieval methods</strong> have become inefficient, often suffering from <strong>incorrect metadata</strong> and <strong>limited keyword-based descriptions</strong>.

To address these challenges, <strong>CBIR utilizes automated feature matching</strong>, comparing images based on <strong>low-level features such as color, texture, and shape</strong> rather than manually assigned keywords. This approach improves <strong>retrieval accuracy</strong> by eliminating dependence on potentially <strong>inaccurate or ambiguous metadata</strong>. However, traditional <strong>CBIR methods</strong> may still return <strong>irrelevant images</strong> that share similar low-level features but do not match the intended search context.

To refine search results and improve accuracy, the system incorporates <strong>relevance feedback</strong>, an advanced technique that enables <strong>iterative learning based on user input</strong>. By analyzing user interactions and adjusting search parameters accordingly, the <strong>CBIR system continuously improves retrieval accuracy</strong>, ensuring that the <strong>most relevant images</strong> are prioritized. This project contributes to the ongoing advancement of <strong>intelligent image search and retrieval technologies</strong>, making <strong>digital image navigation</strong> more effective and user-friendly.
