Led a <strong>Python-based scientific research and development project</strong> to enhance the <strong>accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer classification</strong> in <strong>high-resolution histology images</strong>. 

The project leveraged <strong>deep learning techniques</strong>, integrating a <strong>transfer learning-based Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) model</strong> with a <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier</strong> to improve <strong>cancer histopathology image analysis</strong>. Traditional approaches that extract patches from <strong>gigapixel-sized histology images</strong> often lose <strong>global context</strong>, reducing classification accuracy. To overcome this, the proposed model combined <strong>feature extraction</strong> using <strong>pre-trained networks</strong> with <strong>sequential modeling</strong> through <strong>LSTM</strong>, capturing intricate spatial relationships between image patches. The model was trained and evaluated on the <strong>BreakHis dataset</strong>, achieving a <strong>maximum accuracy of 90.05%</strong>, a notable improvement over <strong>VGG16’s standalone accuracy of 86.9%</strong>. Additionally, the inclusion of a <strong>bidirectional LSTM layer</strong> improved <strong>precision, recall, and AUC values</strong> at <strong>100X magnification</strong>, enhancing the model’s proficiency in <strong>high-resolution image analysis</strong>. This <strong>patch-based classification approach</strong> effectively processes <strong>large tumor regions</strong> without requiring resource-intensive <strong>whole slide image (WSI) analysis</strong>, leading to <strong>faster predictions and optimized computational resource utilization</strong>.
