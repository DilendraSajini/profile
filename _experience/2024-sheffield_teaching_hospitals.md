Worked as a member of the <strong>Clinical Scientific Computing Team</strong>, ensuring the Section provided excellent <strong>clinical scientific computing</strong> support to the Trust and external stakeholders. I provided <strong>professional services</strong> with senior oversight to ensure the appropriate <strong>application of legislation</strong> and standards associated with <strong>clinical scientific computing</strong>.

I <strong>managed projects</strong>, was involved in <strong>system implementations</strong> and <strong>upgrades</strong>, and <strong>ensured the effective and efficient completion</strong> of assigned deliverables. I was responsible for <strong>managing allocated resources</strong>, <strong>project planning</strong>, <strong>gathering requirements</strong>, and <strong>providing training</strong>.

My role involved <strong>supporting the migration of patient data</strong> from the Lorenzo Patient Administration System to the new <strong>Connect Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system</strong>, <strong>ensuring data accuracy and minimal disruption</strong> to patient care. I worked across a broad range of applications in <strong>data science</strong>, statistics, and <strong>healthcare informatics</strong>, with proficiency in the main programming languages—<strong>Python, C#, Java, and SQL</strong>—and various tools, including <strong>Visual Studio, GitLab, VS Code, Docker, Portainer, Nagios, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI</strong>. This enabled me to effectively <strong>analyze and manipulate data</strong> as well as perform <strong>infrastructure monitoring</strong>.

I collaborated with <strong>clinical staff members</strong> to understand their workflows, ensuring that developed solutions (such as <strong>web portals, reporting, and scheduling tools</strong>) were <strong>tailored to the specific needs</strong> of <strong>patient care</strong> and <strong>clinical operations</strong>.
